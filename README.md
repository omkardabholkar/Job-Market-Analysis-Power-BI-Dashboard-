## Project Description
In July 2023, I developed a Job Market Analysis Power BI Dashboard, designed to empower individuals with data-driven insights into the job market, helping them make informed career decisions. This project involved creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes real-time job market performance and trends, utilizing advanced data analysis performed with Python. By incorporating Power BI filters and slicers, I tailored the dashboard to provide role-specific insights, enabling users to explore data relevant to their career paths and eliminating the need for static reports.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For database querying and data manipulation.
- **Power BI**: Used to create interactive dashboards for data visualization.
- **Python**: Employed for advanced data analysis and processing.

## Features
- **Real-Time Job Market Insights**: Visualizations that reflect current job market trends and performance.
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Utilization of Power BI filters and slicers to provide customized insights for different career paths.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Facilitates informed career decisions through comprehensive data analysis.

## Example SQL Code for Data Preparation
Below is an example SQL snippet that might be used to prepare the data for analysis and visualization in Power BI. This code could be part of the process of aggregating job market data for further analysis with Python and visualization with Power BI.

```sql
-- SQL Snippet: Aggregate Job Market Data
SELECT 
    Industry,
    COUNT(JobID) AS NumberOfJobs,
    AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary,
    MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary,
    MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
FROM 
    JobMarketData
GROUP BY 
    Industry
ORDER BY 
    NumberOfJobs DESC;
